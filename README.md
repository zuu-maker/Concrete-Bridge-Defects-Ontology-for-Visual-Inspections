# Concrete Bridge Defects Ontology

Welcome to the Concrete Bridge Defects Ontology repository! This repository contains the ontology developed for the systematic representation and analysis of concrete bridge defects, along with the competency questions.

## Contents

- **Ontology Files**: The ontology is provided in OWL format, compatible with Protege and other ontology editing tools.
- **Competency Questions**: A set of competency questions that the ontology is designed to answer, aimed at validating its effectiveness in representing the domain.
- **SPARQL Queries**: A collection of SPARQL queries corresponding to the competency questions, which can be used to test the ontology, found in ths mix `onto.py`


## How to Use

1. **Download and Open the Ontology**: Download the OWL file and open it in Protege or any other compatible ontology editor.
2. **Explore the Ontology**: Examine the classes, properties, and relationships defined within the ontology to understand its structure.
3. **Run SPARQL Queries**: Use the provided SPARQL queries to test the ontology's ability to answer the competency questions.
4. **Validate with Test Cases**: Apply the test cases to further verify the ontology's accuracy and completeness in representing concrete bridge defects.
